# Loan-E

Student loan tracker app created with SDSC internship 

Creators: Alex Andreiu (PM), Sam Kapusta, Jacob Olivares, Rainee Pei, Daniel Roji, and Steven Wang.

Mission: We developed this application to make it easier for students to know how much loans they have. We even created a feature that looks at all you loan, grants, and scholarship 
information provided by FAFSA and extracts that information for you to see.
